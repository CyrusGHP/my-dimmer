# My Dimmer

My dimmer is a simple arduino coding project that allows a person to hava control over the brightness of an LED in an *Ardiono Uno* board.

## Requirements

1. You will need to have an existing **Arduino IDE** or *install* it if you don't have it already in your PC.

2. You also need to have an **Arduino Uno board**.

3. Some additional electrical components that you may need are the following:
    - Breadboard
    - 3mm LED
    - 220ohm or 330ohm Resistor
    - 10k Potentiometer
    - Jumper wires
    - Dupont Wires.
    

> *Note*: If you don't have any of these components and
> boards on hand, there are web applictions online that
> offers these services online where you can virtually
> simulate the circuits and codes. A lot of these web
> applications need you to sign-up for an account in order
> to access their services so do keep that in mind.
